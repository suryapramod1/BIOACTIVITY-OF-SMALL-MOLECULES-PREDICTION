        "***INTRODUCTION***\n",
        "\n",
        "Our project focuses on developing an intuitive tool utilizing a Bayesian network to swiftly predict the bioactivity of small molecules against target proteins. This endeavor aims to expedite the drug discovery process by leveraging a dataset comprising information on 100 known small molecules, their molecular descriptors, target protein activity, and bioactivity. Through preprocessing, we will partition the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose and Benefits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Primarily situated within the realm of drug discovery and development, our tool holds significant promise. By facilitating the rapid identification of potential candidate molecules for further experimental validation and drug design, it stands to streamline research efforts. Moreover, its utility extends to virtual screening of compound libraries, enabling the prioritization of compounds for experimental testing, and the optimization of lead compounds for enhanced efficacy and safety profiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Background:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the landscape of bioactivity prediction tasks, our project addresses a crucial need for efficient and accurate methodologies. We intend to evaluate the performance of our Bayesian network model using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Additionally, we plan to conduct a comparative analysis, pitting our Bayesian network model against other commonly employed machine learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and potentially deep learning approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the event that the Bayesian network model encounters limitations, we remain flexible in our approach. Alternative strategies, such as employing deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are under consideration. Furthermore, ensemble learning methodologies such as stacking or boosting could be explored to harness the collective strengths of multiple models, thereby enhancing accuracy and robustness."
